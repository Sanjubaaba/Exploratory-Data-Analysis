In this analysis, we explore the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and factors influencing passenger survival. We begin by inspecting data quality, identifying missing values, and cleaning the dataset. Next, we analyze distributions of key features like age, gender, passenger class, and fare. We then detect outliers and examine relationships between variables using visualizations (histograms, box plots, heatmaps). Finally, we investigate survival trends based on demographics, socio-economic status, and family size. This EDA provides valuable insights into why some passengers survived while others did not, helping us understand the real-world implications of this historic tragedy.
